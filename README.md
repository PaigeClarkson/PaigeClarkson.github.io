<ins> Just A Drop: Gas Siphoning Revealed </ins>

**Host- Paige Clarkson:**
It’s great to have you here Guest. Now if you don’t mind me asking, did you know what campus security was up to before your own encounter? 

**Guest:**
[Guest responds to question]

**Host- Paige Clarkson:**
Personally, it really came up as a surprise. Let’s give our listeners the scoop. Just a few days ago, it was revealed that campus security has been secretly siphoning just a single drop of gas from each car everyday to keep their campus security cars running. The cat was let out of the bag when our fellow guest spotted the team sneaking through Lincoln Garage, siphon in hand, gas jug in another. 

Now a few questions for you Guess: Around what time did you spot the incident, and why were you originally there at Lincoln Garage?

**Guest:**

**Host- Paige Clarkson:**
Well it’s lucky you were there at just the right time. Now why do you think they are siphoning a single drop from each of the cars?

**Guest:**
[Guest responds to question]

**Host- Paige Clarkson:**
Interesting. Following the report, I decided to conduct my own investigation of the scandal. I went directly to the source, the chief of the campus security. However, despite my persistence and unmatched charm, I was only able to get minimal information. His only response was, “C’mon, it’s only one drop”. 

And that it is, only one drop - one drop in the ocean of uncovered mysteries waiting to be rightfully revealed to the public. 

Guest, what are your final thoughts on the Gas Siphoning Scandal of BSU?
